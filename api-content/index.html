{"posts":[{"title":"[Database] Ch2 Notebook","content":"The E-R Model The E-R (entity-relationship) data model views the real world as a set of basic objects(entities) and relationships among these objects It is intended primarily for the DB design process by allowing the specification of an enterprise scheme. This represents the overall logical structure of the DB. Entities and Entity Sets An entity is an object that exists and is distinguishable from other objects. For instance, Michelle Lee with S.S.N. 890-12-3456 is an entity, as she can be uniquely identified as one particular person in the universe. An entity may be concrete (a person or a book, for example) or abstract (like a holiday or a disease or a concept). An entity set is a set of entities of the same type (e.g., all persons having an account at a bank). Entity sets need not be disjoint. For example, the entity set Student (all students in a university) and the entity set professor (all professors in a university) may have members in common. (i.e a computer science professor might take a class in anthropology). An entity is represented by a set of attributes. (e.g. name, SSN, Phone-Num for &quot;customer&quot;entity.) The domain of the attribute is the set of permitted values (e.g. the telephone number must be seven positive integers). Formally, an attribute is a function which maps an entity set into a domain. Every entity is described by a set of (attribute, data value) pairs. There is one pair for each attribute of the entity set. e.g. a particular student entity is described by the set {(name, Lee), (SSN, 890-123-456), (street, Blaine), (city, Riverside)}. E-R Diagrams We can express the overall logical structure of a database graphically with an E-R diagram. Its components are: rectangles representing entity sets. ellipses representing attributes. diamonds representing relationship sets. lines linking attributes to entity sets and entity sets to relationship sets. How to represent Constraints(Hugely important) The constraints are given to us from the application Two main kinds of constraints: Key(or cardinality) constraints Participation constraints Key Constraints We can also use arrows to indicate key constraints (often simply referred to as Cardinality Constraints) There are four possible key constraints, they express the number of entities to which another entity can be associated via a relationship. For binary relationship sets between entity sets A and B, the mapping cardinality must be one of: One-to-one: An entity in A is associated with at most one entity in B, and an entity in B is associated with at most one entity in A. One-to-many: An entity in A is associated with any number in B. An entity in B is associated with at most one entity in A. Many-to-one: An entity in A is associated with at most one entity in B. An entity in B is associated with any number in A. Many-to-many: Entities in A and B are associated with any number from each other. Participation Constraints Does every department have a manager? If so, this is a participation constraint: the participation of Departments in Manages is said to be total (vs. partial). Every Departments entity must appear in an instance of the Manages relationship. (Here, every Department must have an employee and every Employee must work in a Department.) Keys Differences between entities must be expressed in terms of attributes. A superkey is a set of one or more attributes which, taken collectively,allow us to identify uniquely an entity in the entity set. For example, in the entity set student; name and S.S.N. is a superkey. Note that name alone is not, as two students could have the same name. A superkey may contain extraneous attributes, and we are often interested in the smallest superkey. A superkey for which no subset is a superkey is called a candidate key. A primary key is a candidate key (there may be more than one) chosen by the DB designer to identify entities in an entity set. The primary key is denoted in an ER diagram by underlining. An entity that has a primary key is called a strong entity. An entity set that does not possess sufficient attributes to form a primary key is called a weak entity set. {Name,Number} is not a superkey, and therefore course is a weak entity. In order to be able to uniquely refer to an item in a weak entity set we must consider some (or all) of its attributes in conjunction with some strong entities primary key. The entity whose primary key is being used is called the identifying owner. ER Design Decisions The use of an attribute or entity set to represent an object. Whether a real-world concept is best expressed by an entity set or a relationship set. The use of a ternary relationship versus a pair of binary relationships. The use of a strong or weak entity set. The use of aggregation – can treat the aggregate entity set as a single unit without concern for the details of its internal structure.

Database Management system(DMBS): Software system designed to store, manage, and access databses. Why need to learn A DBMS allows us to store, modify, and query data. Enforcing Constraints: A DBMS allows us to enforce all kinds of constraints to ensure our data is correct. Scalability: A DBMS enables us to store a very large scale of data. Query Expressiveness: With a DBMS we can search with much more expressive queries. With a DBMS we are completely isolated from the physical structure of our data. If we change the structure of our data (by adding a field, for example) or by changing the order of the data, nothing changes at the front end. Different Views: With a DBMS we can arrange for different people to have different views of the data. Concurrency : Suppose I begin to modify my file at the same time my TA is modifying it! This can lead to inconsistencies. A DBMS will automatically make sure that this cannot happen. Crash Recovery: A DBMS is able to guarantee 100% recovery from system crashes. Security: A DBMS will allow multiple levels of security. Why use a DBMS Data independence Efficient data access Reduced application development time Data integrity and security Uniform data administration Concurrent access, recovery from crashes Why study Databases Shift from computation to information Datasets increasing in diversity and volume DBMS encompasses most of CS!!! Data Models A data model is a collection of concepts for describing data. A schema is a description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model. he relational model is (still) the most widely used model today. relation, basically a table with rows and (named) columns. schema, describes the tables and their columns. Levels of Abstraction External Schema/Views describe how different users see the data Ex: Course_info(cid: string, cname: string, enrollment:integer) Single Conceptual(logical) Schema defines the logical structure of the database Ex: Students(sid: string, name: string, login: string, age: integer gpa:real) Single Physical Schema describes the files and indexes used under the hood Ex: Relations stored as unordered files. Data Independence Applications are insulated from how data is structured and stored. Logical data Independence: Protection from changes in logical structure of data Physical data independence: Protection from changes in physical structure of data One of the most important benefits of using a DBMS! Structure of a DBMS A typical DBMS has a layered architecture The figure does not show th econcurrency contrul and recovery components This is one of several possible architectures; each system has its own variations.
